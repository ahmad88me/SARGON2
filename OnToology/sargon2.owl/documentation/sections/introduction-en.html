    The transition of power systems has introduced unprecedented changes including in energy demand, grid infrastructure, low carbon landscape and more renewable energy resources (RES). Due to the fact that these power systems highly rely on the digital architecture and also include multiple domains, the interoperability of heterogeneous data across various domains within the energy sector has become a major challenge. To tackle this problem, ontologies are considered as a essential component of the semantic web for providing the knowledge about entities and their relationships in both human and machine-readable formats. This work develops SARGON2 which is an extension of SARGON using a semi-automatic ontology development framework and the schema annotation of the resulting ontology to integrate with the existing standards like Common Information Model (CIM). SARGON2 aims to include the entities such as renewable energy resources (biomass, biogas, geothermal, solar, and wind), building domain, and non-energy domain including weather information.

    On the other hand, data spaces are essential for promoting the digitalization of power systems, leading to a new era characterized by enhanced efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. On the other hand, the key idea of data space is to store the data at the source, which does not require a central data base. Unlike the database, the data provider and the data customer in a data space need to agree on the common principles prior to data sharing. The main components of the data space are trust framework, log services, vocabulary hub, contracting, and publication \& discovery. Moreover, various stakeholders such as utilities, data providers, and data consumers with different levels of knowledge are interconnected to the data space. As a consequence, this kind of data management systems can introduce the scalability challenges, complexity in maintenance for handling unstructured or rapidly changing data.  In this paper, we focus on the vocabulary hub part, in the sense of ontology, to solve the problem of heterogeneous data by developing SARGON2 ontology.</span>
